Madam, Sir,

I am writing to you with great enthusiasm and determination to join your company for my end-of-studies project. As a future engineer specializing in Data Science and Software, I am convinced that an experience at {entreprise} would be a key milestone in my career, offering me the opportunity to apply my skills in Data Science, DevOps, and software engineering within a stimulating and innovative environment.

During my studies at ENSIAS, I have had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies while developing a comprehensive understanding of the technological challenges facing today’s companies. Passionate about optimizing and automating systems, I have been involved in projects combining data collection, processing, and analysis, as well as the deployment of solutions at an enterprise scale. This versatility, strengthened by my curiosity for technical challenges, has enriched my approach and my ability to work effectively with multidisciplinary teams.

My experience has allowed me to gain diverse and practical expertise. For example, during my internship with Groupe Rahal, I participated in creating a web application for managing international events, a project where attention to detail and rigor were essential. More recently, with Groupe OCP, I contributed to strategic machine learning initiatives for product price forecasting, which enabled me to combine analytical skills with the ability to develop solutions tailored to end-users’ needs.

Joining {entreprise} is a genuine motivation for me, given the excellence of your projects and your focus on innovation. Aware of the importance of an environment that encourages initiative and teamwork, I am particularly attracted by the prospect of contributing to your projects and learning from your experts.

I am available for an interview to discuss this opportunity in detail. Thank you for your consideration, and please accept my best regards.
